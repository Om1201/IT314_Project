This is a paraphrased version of the interview audio file.

**Question:** Based on your previous experience of coding, say DSA in C++, would you prefer having an explanation of the new language you are learning taking in account this previous knowledge?

**Answer:** After doing DSA or CP (competitive Programming), mostly CP, there is a huge increase in coding aptitude. So the need for videos or information of the basics of a new language need not be repeated again and again like you would need to with a beginner.

**Question:** So, basically you do not want the pre-requisites/basic knowledge to be given to you,i.e., you want the system to assume that you have a certain amount of knowledge before hand ?

**Answer:** Not specifically that, when you are a beginner, even when reading the documentation of that language, the basic stuff is constantly repeated to take account of varying levels of coding experience.
Instead of constantly repeating those basics, mention it once, and move on to the main programming that should be learnt. As a beginner, constantly repeating the basics, in a way, fits it into their brain. Someone who is an experienced coder, need not be reminded constantly of the basics in furhter steps. If the basics are displayed once, based on the experience level, you could mention that this information will not be repeated constantly and that now we will move on to the main things in the language that are to be learnt.

**Question:** So the basic info will be shown once, and then will not be mentioned later onwards if the user has mentioned that they are a experienced coder ?

**Answer:** Yes, that is because the data becomes redundant or irritating as I would have to read through it. Even intermediate stuff can be skipped if preferred by the user, as for me in VS Code loops is a basic topic, but for a beginner it might be a bit more tough. I would prefer skipping the basics related to that in the new language im learning as I have been working with loops for a long time.

**Question:** In our first sprint, we have thought about a few features to implement, such as user authentication, login, and roadmap generation. In the roadmap generation part would you prefer having questions after a certain subset of topics or would you rather have questions or projects to help you evaluate your progress/ check if you have learnt the concepts? Along with that if provided an option to prefer articles or videos for your topics reference material?

**Answer:** I would prefer an option for videos or articles/documentation based on my preferences. For the other question, A questio based approach would not yield any meaningful results, it is not worth it, and beginners and even advanced coders should stay away from such an approach. POroject based evaluation is much more superior, as the concepts you have learnt are being put to the test. Along with that, you have to actually think and apply your brain, companies will not ask you to solve questions, but ratherprefer if you are a problem solver. If only questions are done with 1 or 2 projects, it isnt enough. Instead of that working on multiple small projects then a few big projects , it will help you improve your problem solving capabilities. If your website can have the feature to ask AI.

**Question:** There will be AI implemented in the website. Just to confirm, you are saying that the project based approach is much more superior and questions should be avoided completely ?

**Answer:** Yes, it would be much more superior. Questions should be completely avoided, and this would help create an authenticty for the user who does projects is going to be more capable compared to one who only solves questions, in my opinion. One more thing, in the question based approachje it would take less time, bnut projects will take a lot of time. So if time is not a constraint then projects are the way to go.

**Question:** As far as I know regarding Errors in VS Code, it shows the errors in the code before you run the code right ?
**Answer:**Only for syntax related errors, like the errors that can be seen before running the code. 

**Question:** So basically if there is an error, you get it during the runtime, for ecample this variable is missing etc etc. Would you prefer the AI assistant points where the error is and fix it for you or would you prefer it guides you through the error? This is considering that the current practices in the IT industry involve people using AI to assist them in their code.

**Answer:** Here's the thing regarding this, at one time I did not know what an segmentation fault is, which is basically accessing a part of the memory which hasnt been used by the compiler/coder. If you start by using AI Assistance for solving errors instead of learning about the errors and it cause, it will take a lot of time to actually fix the problem. In the short term you may only save a few seconds if you know what the error is and are able to directly fix it as you have knowledge about it. But over a long period of time, by compounding this time saved, you end up saving a lot of time. Learning about the error and actually using AI to guide you through how the error occured and what to avoid, steps on how to fix it instead of it just fixing it would be more beneficial.

**Question:** So, when I say guided by the AI, if possible to implement, would you prefer it provides you soruces and documentation regarding the error or would you rather have it explain it you by itself?
**Answer:** If possible,, then Yes, I would prefer having the sources/documentation regarding the error, so that I can learn mre details about the error.
