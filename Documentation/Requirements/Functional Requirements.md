# **Functional Requirements:**

**1. User Signup with Email and Password or using Google Authentication**  
The platform should provide registration options where users can create an account using their email and password or sign in quickly via Google authentication. 

**2. Reset Password**  
Users should be able to reset their password in case they forget it, typically through a secure email or OTP verification process. This ensures account recovery and uninterrupted access to the platform.

**3. User Profile**  
Each user should have a profile where they can specify their learning goals, preferred programming languages, and prior experience.

**4. Roadmap Generation Based on Topics Given by User**  
The system must generate a proper roadmap of learning modules based on the topics that the user wants. Also the roadmap will be given based on the experience level of the user like if he is a begineer or advanced level, roadmap will be given accordingly.

**5. Integrated IDE**  
A built-in integrated coding environment (IDE) should be available for users to write and run their code without leaving the platform. This promotes hands-on practice.

**6. AI Assistance for Errors**  
The platform should integrate AI-powered support to analyze code errors and explain the underlying cause in simple terms when asked by the user.

**7. Quizzes/Tests After Each Block in the Roadmap**   
After completing each major section of the roadmap, the system should provide quizzes or coding tests to evaluate the userâ€™s understanding of the concepts before progressing further. the quiz shal be generated using AI.

**8. External Reources for Each Topic**    
For each topic in the module, the platform should recommend external resources such as articles, documentation, or videos related to the topic. This helps the user to learn and also saves his time for not having to manually search for resources for each topic.

**9. Notes (with optional Markdown support)**   
Users should be able to take and save notes within the platform during their learning. Notes shoulkd optionally support markdown formatting for better structuring (headings, code snippets, lists, etc.).

**10. Automated Time and Space Complexity Calculations**   
The platform should analyze user-written code and display its time and space complexity, when asked by the user to do so. This feature will help learners understand efficiency considerations and write optimized programs.
