## 3. Observations
- Initial meetings had unclear role distribution → caused delays.
- Had conflicts in discussion, can be avoided with better communication.
- Can make better use of time by assigning roles earlier next time.
- Mid-evaluation tasks aligned naturally with Scrum artifacts (user stories, EPICs, sprints).

---

## 4. Next Steps
- Complete Sprint 1 POC (authentication).
- Finalize poster, FRs/NFRs, user stories before submission.
- Track GitHub contributions for explicit member work logs.
- Discussion about Sprint 2 after evaluation and identifying the specific user stories for the same.

---

## 5. Backlog
- **No backlog** for Sprint 1 as of now.
- Sprint 1 initial goal: Authentication (implemented).
