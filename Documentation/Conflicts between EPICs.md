# Conflicts Between EPICs


## 1. Epic 2 (Learning Experience & Roadmap) vs Epic 3 (Coding Environment & AI Assistance)
- **Evaluation & IDE Link:** Evaluations/quizzes in Epic 2 (Sprint 3) may require coding exercises to run in the IDE (Epic 3, Sprint 4).  

**Possible Resolution :**  We can complete Sprint 4 (IDE setup) before implementing evaluation-related tasks in Sprint 5.
