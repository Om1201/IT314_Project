## This is the summary of the interview.

**Question:** 

What motivated you to learn coding (career, academics, personal interest, etc.)?

**Answer:** 

Mainly career reasons. I want to get into a well paying job, and I know coding skills are essential for internships and placements. But I also enjoy solving logical problems, so it’s a kind of both career and interest.

**Question:** 

What do you want to from  an online code learning platform?

**Answer:** 

I primarly want to learn programming from basics to advanced so that I can prepare for online assesments and coding interviews, and also learn how to work on real projects. For this I want to learn various tech stacks from begineer to advanced level.

**Question:** 

Which programming languages or technologies are you most interested in learning?

**Answer:** 

Since I already know C++, right now I would like to learn Python and JavaScript because they’re widely used and can be beneficial in interviews. Later, I’d like to learn frameworks like React and maybe Java or Node.js for backend.

**Question:** 

What difficulties do you usually face while learning coding online?

**Answer:** 

One problem is that too much of time is wasted on searching for resources, like when you are learning a particular topic, you need to search and navigate through videos on Youtube or GeeksforGeeks and for that particular topic there are many other prerequisites that again I have to search and overall the process becomes very time consuming an inefficient.

**Question:** 

Would you like properly structured roadmaps to solve your problem?

**Answer:** 

Yes, it would be very much helpful. A properly structured roadmap with links of relevant resources like articles or videos could make my task much faster and could save a lot of time.

**Question:** 

Do you prefer accessing the platform on a mobile app, a desktop website, or both?

**Answer:**

Generally I do coding on laptop, so I would prefer a desktop website. I dont think anybody will use a coding platform on mobile, so making a mobile application is pointless.

---

**Question:** 

What’s one feature you wish existed in every coding learning platform?

**Answer:** 

I would prefer a doubt assistant — what happens is while coding I get stuck in some problem, so at that time if an AI assistant can give me hints to complete the problem or point out erros which I have made in my code, that would be very much helpful, especially for begineers or when I am learning a new tech stack from scratch. I would also like to have a timer in the IDE to solve questions in time constraint.
